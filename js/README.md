# Smart Home Dashboard - JavaScript Architecture

## Overview
The JavaScript code has been reorganized into a modular structure for better maintainability and organization. Each module handles a specific aspect of the application.

## Module Structure

### Core Modules (`js/core/`)
- **`state.js`** - Global state management, helper functions, and utility functions
- **`notifications.js`** - Notification system functionality

### Device Modules (`js/devices/`)
- **`device-icons.js`** - Device type icons and icon mapping
- **`device-controls.js`** - Device-specific control functions (lights, fans, TVs, etc.)
- **`device-cards.js`** - Device card creation and rendering logic

### Modal Modules (`js/modals/`)
- **`device-modal.js`** - Device editing modal functionality

### Feature Modules
- **`js/schedule/schedule.js`** - Schedule functionality and event management
- **`js/dashboard/dashboard.js`** - Dashboard rendering and charts
- **`js/analytics/analytics.js`** - Analytics dashboard and charts
- **`js/settings/settings.js`** - Settings page functionality

### Navigation and Events
- **`js/navigation/navigation.js`** - Tab switching and navigation logic
- **`js/events/event-handlers.js`** - All event listeners and initialization

### Main Application
- **`js/app-new.js`** - Main application entry point

## Loading Order
The modules are loaded in dependency order:
1. Core state management (must be first)
2. Notifications system
3. Device icons and controls
4. Device cards and rendering
5. Modals and dialogs
6. Schedule functionality
7. Dashboard functionality
8. Analytics functionality
9. Settings functionality
10. Navigation system
11. Event handlers and initialization

## Benefits of This Structure
- **Modularity**: Each file has a single responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- **Reusability**: Functions can be easily reused across modules
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features by creating new modules
- **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation

## Migration Notes
The original `app.js` file has been split into these modules. All functionality remains the same, but the code is now better organized and easier to maintain.
